# pengangkutan-Awam

Trying to create a simple public-transport-plan program that includes all the public transports in Kuala Lumpur.
Focus should be on taking all the map data from:-

1. Rapid Rail
2. KTM Commuter (only K.L)
3. Rapid Bus

This program should have algorithm(s) that calculates the best (shortest!) way to be on a selected destination.
This program does not have a real/time application and is available offline.
And of course, plan(?) to be integrated into android app. Who knows, if I have time.
